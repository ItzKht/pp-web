    <div class="heading">My Forever Proposal üå∏</div>

    <p>From the first day we spoke, I never knew that the girl who was just a name to me once would become the peace of my chaotic life. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt looking for love, but your presence felt like home in a world that never felt mine. Mujhe nahi pata tha ki kisi se itna attach ho sakta hoon bina intention ke, bina expectations ke.</p>

    <p>I know you‚Äôre scared that someday I‚Äôll also leave you like everyone else. But I want to tell you today ‚Äì I‚Äôm not here to use you or timepass with you. I‚Äôm here to choose you every single day, without any conditions.</p>

    <p>I can‚Äôt promise expensive gifts, foreign trips, or diamonds today. But I promise you respect, loyalty, care, and pure love. I promise ki mai kabhi bina tumhare permission ke touch nahi karunga, I‚Äôll never judge you for your dressing, choices, or past. For me, you are perfect with all your flaws and scars.</p>

    <p>I know sometimes you feel like a burden because of family problems, career stress, ya tumhare fears. But I promise you ‚Äì tum kabhi bhi mere liye bojh nahi hogi. Tumhare har fear ko mai apni himmat se cover karunga. Tumhare har sapne ko apna sapna banaunga. Tumhare har struggle me mai tumhara partner rahunga.</p>

    <p>Main dating isliye nahi karna chahta kyunki mujhe timepass chahiye. I want to date you because I see you as my future, my wife, my home. One day, I will be successful enough to spoil you with all those gifts, trips, and comforts you deserve. But until then, I want to build with you, grow with you, and support you.</p>

    <p>I can‚Äôt promise ki life perfect hogi, but I promise I‚Äôll stand with you in every imperfection, every pain, every downfall, and every success.</p>

    <p>üå∏ Can I be yours forever? Can I be the one who holds your hand through every storm, wipes every tear, celebrates every smile, and makes you feel every single day that you are the most precious blessing this universe could ever gift me?</p>

    <p>If you need time, please take it. I will wait with the same hope, love, and respect for you.</p>
