    <h2>5 Times I Saw You</h2>
    <p>
At first, I didn't even know much about you. Bas naam suna tha – Manya. Khushi ki ek friend hai, that’s it. I thought, “Okay, hoti hain normal ladkiyaan…” but little did I know, you were going to be someone so special one day.

The first time I saw you was when you were on your scooty with Khushi, bada bazar aur holi chowk ke beech wale raste par. I was talking to my friend, and you passed by. Maine zyada notice nahi kiya… bas socha, “Theek hai bhai, ladki hi toh hai.” But if only I knew, us din meri nazar kis pe padi thi.

The second time was months later. I was going to play cricket in Jamuna Vihar, aur tum scooty se wapas jaa rahi thi. Again, I thought the same – “Normal ladki hogi, Manya hi toh hai.” I never imagined that one day, this “normal ladki” would mean the world to me.

Then came the third time. That morning, when you and Khushi were going to gym together. Us din maine notice kiya… how much you have changed in almost two years. And I was like, “Wow… Manya is different now. Bilkul alag… aur itni sundar.”

The fourth time was special. We met in front of Mapango Pizza after gym, jab main Khushi se milne aaya tha. And unexpectedly, I met you too. Humari choti si baat hui thi vaha, but us din pata nahi kyun, dil ko sukoon sa mila tha.

And finally, the fifth time – the most beautiful one. Jab hum teeno saath me MacD gaye the. We talked, laughed, shared stories, and I saw a different side of you. Us din laga, “Ye ladki kitni alag hai… kitni pure hai… aur pata nahi kyun, mujhe bahut achhi lagi.”
