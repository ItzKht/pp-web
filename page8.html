    <h1>ðŸŒ¸ Insecurity Page</h1>
    <p>
Sometimes, I see those hidden fears in your eyes, Manya.
I know there are moments when you feel youâ€™re not enoughâ€¦ when your own family doesnâ€™t prioritise you the way you deserveâ€¦ when your dreams seem too far away. But listen to me today â€“ tum jitni ho, jaise ho, mere liye perfect ho.

I know youâ€™ve been hurt before, by people who were supposed to protect youâ€¦ and I can never even imagine raising my voice, let alone my hand, on you. Tumhara respect, tumhari safety, tumhari smileâ€¦ ye sab mere liye sabse pehle aayega.

Sometimes you feel insecure about your career, your future, or even your body and looks. But for me, tumhara dil sabse khoobsurat cheez hai.
Your dreams are mine now too, and I promise, Iâ€™ll support you in every decision you take â€“ bina judge kiye, bina rok-tok ke.

No matter how many scars your past has left, rememberâ€¦
I am not here to fix you â€“ I am here to hold your hand and love you as you are, with every little fear and every big dream you carry in your heart.
    </p>

    <div class="promise-note">
      ðŸŒŸ <b>Promise Note:</b><br>
      I promise I will never touch you without your permission. I promise I will never judge you for what you wear or what you dream of becoming. I promise to make you feel loved, respected, and safe â€“ every single day.
