      I just want you to know, Manya, that it’s completely okay. I know feelings can’t be forced, and I will never hold it against you.
      <br><br>
      Tumhare liye jo feel karta hoon, vo sirf ek proposal tak limited nahi hai. It’s much more than that – it’s respect, care, and gratitude for existing in my life.
      <br><br>
      Please don’t ever feel guilty or awkward around me if your answer is no. I promise, I’ll still be there to cheer you up on your bad days, tease you on your sleepy calls, and support you in every little dream you share with me.
      <br><br>
      This proposal was not to burden you but to free my heart from unsaid feelings. And I know, no matter what your answer is, tum mere liye hamesha wahi Manya rahogi jisse baat karke din ban jata hai.
      <br><br>
      I will always pray for your happiness, your peace, and your success. Because seeing you smile will always be enough for me.
      <br><br>
      🌸 “So yes, even if you say no, thank you… for letting me love you this way.”
